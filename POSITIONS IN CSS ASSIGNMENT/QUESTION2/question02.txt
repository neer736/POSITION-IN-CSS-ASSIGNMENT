Absolute Positioning:

Elements with absolute positioning are positioned relative to their nearest positioned ancestor (an ancestor that has a position property other than static), if any. If there is no positioned ancestor, the element is positioned relative to the initial containing block, which is usually the <html> element.
The element is taken out of the normal flow of the document, meaning it doesn't affect the layout of other elements on the page.
Use properties like top, right, bottom, and left to specify the exact position of the element.


Relative Positioning:

Elements with relative positioning are still considered part of the normal flow of the document.
The element is positioned relative to its normal position in the document flow, but you can then adjust its position using the top, right, bottom, and left properties.
If no positioning values are specified (top, right, bottom, left), the element will be displayed in its normal position.
